* What is this repository?
These are my dotfiles (configuration files) for my NixOS setup(s).

Here is my main setup:
[[themes/ayu-dark/ayu-dark.png]]

* Notes for Myself
To get this running on a NixOS system, I will start by cloning the repo:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
git clone https://gitlab.com/librephoenix/nixos-config.git /path/to/my/config/folder
#+END_SRC

To get the hardware configuration on a new system, I can other copy from =/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix= or run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
sudo nixos-generate-config --dir /dotfiles/path/system
#+END_SRC

Then, I can switch into the system configuration by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
cd /dotfiles/path
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#snowfire
#+END_SRC

Home manager can be installed with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update
nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
#+END_SRC

If home-manager starts to not cooperate, it may be because the unstable branch of nixpkgs is in the Nix channel list.  This can be fixed via:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
#+END_SRC

Home-manager may also not work without re-logging back in after it has been installed.

Once home-manager is running, my home-manager configuration can be installed with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
home-manager switch --flake .#emmet
#+END_SRC

This loads in my convenience script =phoenix=, which replaces frequently used nix and nixos commands with more user friendly ones, namely:
- =phoenix sync= to build and switch system and home configuration
  - =phoenix sync system= to build and switch only system configuration
  - =phoenix sync user= to build and switch only home configuration
- =phoenix update= to update flake inputs
- =phoenix gc= to garbage collect
  - If no argument is given, it cleans anything older than 30 days
  - If a time argument is supplied (i.e. 10d), it cleans stuff older than that (10 days in this example)
  - If the argument =full= is given, it deletes /all/ previous generations
