** What is this repository?
These are my dotfiles (configuration files) for my NixOS setup(s).

Here is my main setup:
[[themes/ayu-dark/ayu-dark.png]]

** Install
I wrote some reinstall notes for myself [[./install.org][here (install.org)]].

** Modules
Separate Nix files can be imported as modules using an import block:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
imports = [ import1.nix
            import2.nix
            ...
          ];
#+END_SRC

This conveniently allows configurations to be separated and swapped around quickly.

I have my modules separated into two groups:
- System-level - stored in the [[./system][system directory]]
  - System-level modules are imported into [[./system/configuration.nix][configuration.nix]], which is what is sourced into [[./flake.nix][my flake (flake.nix)]]
- User-level - stored in the [[./user][user directory]] (managed by home-manager)
  - User-level modules are imported into [[./user/home.nix][home.nix]], which is also sourced into [[./flake.nix][my flake (flake.nix)]]

More detailed information on these specific modules are in the [[./system][system directory]] and [[./user][user directory]] respectively.
