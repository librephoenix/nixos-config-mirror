** What is this repository?
These are my dotfiles (configuration files) for my NixOS setup(s).

Here is my main setup:
[[themes/ayu-dark/ayu-dark.png]]

** My 55+ Themes
[[https://github.com/danth/stylix#readme][Stylix]] (and [[https://github.com/SenchoPens/base16.nix#readme][base16.nix]], of course) is amazing, allowing you to theme your entire system with base16-themes.

Using this I have [[./themes][55+ themes]] (I add more sometimes) I can switch between on-the-fly. Visit the [[./themes][themes directory]] for more info and screenshots!

** Install
I wrote some reinstall notes for myself [[./install.org][here (install.org)]].

** Modules
Separate Nix files can be imported as modules using an import block:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
imports = [ import1.nix
            import2.nix
            ...
          ];
#+END_SRC

This conveniently allows configurations to be (*cough cough) /modular/ (ba dum, tssss).

I have my modules separated into two groups:
- System-level - stored in the [[./system][system directory]]
  - System-level modules are imported into configuration.nix, which is what is sourced into [[./flake.nix][my flake (flake.nix)]]
- User-level - stored in the [[./user][user directory]] (managed by home-manager)
  - User-level modules are imported into home.nix, which is also sourced into [[./flake.nix][my flake (flake.nix)]]

More detailed information on these specific modules are in the [[./system][system directory]] and [[./user][user directory]] respectively.

** Profiles
I separate my configurations into [[./profiles][profiles]] (essentially system templates), i.e:
- [[./profiles/personal][Personal]] - What I would run on a personal laptop/desktop
- [[./profiles/work][Work]] - What I would run on a work laptop/desktop (if they let me bring my own OS :P)
- [[./profiles/homelab][Homelab]] - What I would run on a server or homelab

My profile can be conveniently selected in [[./flake.nix][my flake.nix]] by setting the =profile= variable.

More detailed information on these profiles is in the [[./profiles][profiles directory]].
